# playOS
PlayOS custom RaspberryPi OS to play around with buildroot.

To build and use the image, do the following:

1) Install development dependencies by running './dev_setup.sh'
2) Run 'make buildroot'
3) Grab a coffee until it finishes compiling
4) Grab your favorite imaging tool or use dd and write the output image './bsp/buildroot-rpi4/output/images/sdcard.img'

Have fun!
